This repository is created to share the code and the processed data for the *Mockingbird* defense ([arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06626)) which is designed to work against deep-learning-based website fingerprinting attacks. Even though we are not sharing the code before the publication, the pseudocode in the paper provides necessary details to write the code from scratch.
